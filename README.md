# ðŸ“ˆ Yield Curve Forecasting Model


An R-based analytical code for yield curve analysis and optimal investment strategy recommendation. The model evaluates yield curve shapes and suggests the most effective fixed-income investment horizons (1-5 years) for present value maximization.



## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Yield Curve Analysis**:
  - Automated shape classification (normal, inverted, flat, steep)
  - Slope and level analysis
  - Visualization tools for curve inspection

- **Investment Strategy**:
  - Optimal maturity recommendation engine
  - Present value maximization algorithm
  - 1-5 year fixed rate comparisons

- **Data Generation**:
  - Random yield curve simulation
  - Historical pattern replication
  - Custom parameter inputs
