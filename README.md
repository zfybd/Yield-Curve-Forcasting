# Yield-Curve-Forcasting
The objective is to create a model that enables the identification of the optimal investment strategy for
maximizing present value. The model will take a randomly generated yield curve as input (for example,
the current yield curve). The outcomes will include: 1) an analysis of the yield curve's shape ( based on
slope and absolute level) and 2) recommendations on the most effective investment strategy (whether to
invest in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5-year fixed rates).

In the project, the programming language is R
